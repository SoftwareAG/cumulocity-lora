/**
 * C8yStepperButtons provides a convinient way to have, according to
 * the C8yStepper and each cdk-step, buttons to navigate between steps or to cancel the whole
 * step-process. Buttons rendered with the help of this component will use the branding css.
 *
 * By default all steps with this component in use will render a next button, expect the last step.
 * The other way around, every step using this component will render a back button, expect the first step.
 * To get a cancel button rendered you need to handle the onCancel event.
 * For next and back button you don't need to handle the available events onNext and onBack because default behavior
 * is implemented. The default will just call, according to the button, the stepper.next() or stepper.previous()
 * methods and moves the stepper forth or back. Using the EventEmitter onNext and onBack will emit for you the following
 * object: {stepper: C8yStepper, step: CdkStep}. This is useful if you need to implement custom logic before moving
 * to the next step or sending data to a backend. In this case you need to tell the stepper to move forward or back
 * on your own.
 *
 * With the component input [labels] you can change the label of each button in each step. It takes an object like this:
 * {next?: string, back?: string, cancel?: string}
 *
 * The [pending] input is of type boolean and will enable css animation for the next button when true.
 *
 * If the cdk-step provides a stepControl the component will set the next button disabled when the formGroup
 * behind it is invalid. As long as the [pending] input is true the back and next button is also disabled.
 * This will prevent multiple clicks while running a request or stepping back while a request is ongoing.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * <c8y-stepper>
 *  <cdk-step>
 *    <!--
 *      your html code
 *          ...
 *          ...    -->
 *    <c8y-stepper-buttons
 *     (onNext)="save()"
 *     [labels]="{ next: 'Save' }"
 *     [pending]="pendingStatus"
 *     ></c8y-stepper-buttons>
 *  </cdk-step>
 * </c8y-stepper>
 *
 * // in your component:
 * async save() {
 *   this.pendingStatus = true;
 *   // your async request goes here ...
 *   // await something();
 *   this.pendingStatus = false;
 *   this.stepper.next();
 * }
 * ```
