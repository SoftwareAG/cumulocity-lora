/**
 * A directive to iterate over IResultList<T> data from @c8y/client.
 * Depending on the [c8yForLoadMore] a load more button is:
 *  - auto: Tries to automatically load more data (default maximum 10 iterations; can be
 *          change with maxIterations settings).
 *  - show: Shows a load more button for the user to decide
 *  - none: Doesn't perform any load more action.
 *  - hidden: Loads more data automatically but with no visible button for the user.
 *
 * Additional, any rxjs operator pipe can be applied to the [c8yForPipe] input, e.g. to
 * filter the data displayed currently as well as the data loaded by subsequent requests.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```html
 * <div *c8yFor="let device of devices; loadMore: 'auto'; let i = index; pipe: filterPipe;">
 *  {{ i + 1 }}. {{device.name}}
 * </div>
 * ```
 * The above example will list all entities that are applied to `devices`:
 * ```typescript
 * this.devices = this.inventoryService.list({ pageSize: 10, fragmentType: 'c8y_IsDevice' })
 * ```
 * It will display the first 10 items, if there is more space left on the screen, and there are more
 * than 10 devices, it will automatically load up to 10 pages more. If it still can't fit the screen
 * it will stop and switch to `show` mode.
 *
 * A pipe can be applied e.g. for filtering or grouping. This pipe is attached to every follow up
 * request done by the load more component:
 * ```typescript
 * this.filterPipe = pipe(
 *    map((data: []) => {
 *     return data.filter(
 *      (mo: any) => mo.name && mo.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(value.toLowerCase()) > -1
 *    );
 *  })
 * );
 * ```
 * The pipe must be an rxjs pipe and can take any operator.
