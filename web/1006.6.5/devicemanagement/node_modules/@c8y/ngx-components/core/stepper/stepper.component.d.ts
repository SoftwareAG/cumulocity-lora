/**
 * C8yStepper extends the CdkStepper. You can use cdk based functionality and inputs.
 * Additional to that you are able to modify the behavior and also the look and feel when
 * using the C8yStepper.
 *
 * The C8yStepper is used to present any step-based process to the user.
 * A stepper, C8yStepper and/or CdkStepper is the parent of cdk-steps.
 * Each cdk-step represents one step in the whole process that you want to provide to the user.
 *
 * The C8yStepper will create, based on the given cdk-steps, a kind of stepper-progress which looks like this:
 * (1)---(2)---(3)---(n)
 * The stepper will handle the state of each step and provides styles for active steps, done-steps or in edit-mode.
 * You are able to override icons for each step in the stepper-progress with a template. You are also able to activate
 * default-icons for states like 'edit' and 'done'.
 *
 * To force users through every provided step, set the stepper to 'linear'.
 * This will disable the possibility to move for example from step one to step three.
 *
 * Whenever it comes to validation try to use formGroups. It is possible to
 * assign a formGroup to a cdk-step input called [stepControl], which automatically respects the
 * validation-rules that you created for this formGroup. If fields are required but not filled or
 * any other validation, like a pattern, is not matched the formGroup will be invalid. In this case
 * stepping in a linear stepper to the next step gets impossible.
 *
 * If there is the need to execute asynchronous code you have at least two possibilities.
 * First: As you learned, a cdk-step works with formGroups and Validators, so you are able to use
 * asyncValidators as well.
 * Second: The C8yStepper provides an event-emitter onStepChange which is called whenever a step-button (1)--(2)--(n)
 * in the stepper-progress is clicked. The event of this emitter holds the index of the step as number. You can
 * use this EventEmitter to call for example a custom navigate-method which performs first any async-call and then moves
 * on to the given step.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * <c8y-stepper
 * (onStepChange)="navigate($event)"
 * [disableDefaultIcons]="{ edit: true, done: false }"
 * [customClasses]="['m-l-40', 'm-r-40', 'm-t-32']"
 * linear
